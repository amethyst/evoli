# Evoli
A micro-ecosystem simulation game, progressively designed and developed as an official showcase project for the Amethyst engine. The current iteration of the game (v0.2 and onwards) simulates a few different species occupying the same, limited space.

For more information about the current game design and our goals and history so far, read [our introduction](https://community.amethyst.rs/t/evoli-introduction/770).

## Install / Play

Make sure you have Git LFS installed when cloning the repository as most assets are stored there.

If you are compiling on Linux, you need to install some dependencies first. They are necessary to compile and run the Amethyst engine. Please follow the instructions in the [Amethyst README](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst#dependencies).

Ensure you have Cargo installed ([use rustup if you don't](https://rustup.rs/)), and run the following:

```
cargo run
```

If you run into issues please report them here or on http://discord.gg/amethyst in the #showcase-game channel.

## Profiling
We use the same profiling library Amethyst uses. Run the game with
```
cargo run --release --features profiler
```
then exit the game without a crash to generate a file `thread_profile.json`.
See the Amethyst instructions [Profiling the engine](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#profiling-the-engine) on
how to use that file.

Search the code for `profile_scope` for an example on how to add profiling markers to the code.
